# 🌊 Flood Relief & Damage Analysis — Pakistan (NGO/Relief Focused)

## 📖 Introduction
Floods in Pakistan have caused **widespread human and economic losses**, leaving millions of people homeless and vulnerable.  
This project provides a **Power BI Dashboard** designed specifically for **NGOs, relief organizations, and policymakers** to better understand the scale of the disaster and allocate resources effectively.  

By consolidating key statistics such as **casualties, injuries, affected population, housing damage, and livestock losses**, this dashboard serves as a **data-driven decision support tool** for humanitarian response.

## ❗ Problem Statement
Natural disasters like floods create **urgent needs for relief operations** but decision-makers often lack a **clear, data-driven overview** of the most affected regions.  

Without proper visualization:
- Relief efforts may be **delayed or misallocated**  
- Vulnerable communities may not get **timely assistance**  
- Resources for **rehabilitation** may remain under-utilized  

This dashboard attempts to bridge that gap by **transforming raw data into actionable insights**.

## 🎯 Objectives
The main goals of this dashboard are:
1. To provide **real-time visualization** of flood impacts across Pakistan.  
2. To help NGOs & agencies **prioritize regions** for relief distribution.  
3. To track **human, housing, and livestock damages** at a regional level.  
4. To offer a **user-friendly and interactive dashboard** that simplifies decision-making.
